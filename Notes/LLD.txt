private attributes are only set in constructor and cannot be used outside
Client should not know all the details
BEcause of polymorphism the client can only access a single type but provider can give different type of object

Constructor with base keyword - it doesn't create a new object
How will compiler know the Copy of Istudent vs student
Which constructor will be called first and whose property will be filled first

inherited -> base upcasting
base -> inherited downcasting

SO object creation can be costly 
- it might require to get values from DB
so if we want to create simillar object we can have a copy from the prototype

open closed princple bird with a new type

Even if I have base ka object but derived ka ref type we wont be able to actually find propert of derived
Dependency inversion - no 2 classes should directly talk to interface

Practical factory
Factory
Abstract factory

Flutter design and payment design adapter and abstract factory

Dependency inversion -- tightly coupled importing library(payumoney and phone pe)

Code to interface and not an implementation

Adapter design pattern - DI and OCP - Solve the problem of external library  Databases

Different ways to do something strategy design pattern - google maps

observer design pattern flipkart triggers

Deorator is also known as wrapper

vanilla then choclate vs reverse
HTML Component
Flutter - Attributes

Everything is developed over a base
What abt if base itself is taken care as addon(Constructor dependency)

Pubg game working - ram storing then changes are shared
Extrinsic and intrinsic

Boundary - Internal and external (Rectangle)

Usecase-
We use verb to represent any action(Oval)

Actor
User and should be Noun(Man sign)

Includes are not order relation Login -> Report 
It should be Checkout includes check availability 

Extends Mutiple ways to a same usecase
